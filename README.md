RealTicket 0.8 (Mouse) 
===========

About the Contributer:
     "I brought myself this far with no assistance. Perhaps I needed it? Check me out." 
This is supposed to be a Ticketing Software. Help me get it there by Nov. 8th...

It primarily uses Python for the server.
It primarily uses HTML5 and Twitter Bootstrap with Angular.js for the client.
The Python web framework is primarily Flask with a tiny touch of cgi.

In need of a documenting solution... a whiz at Javascript, HTML, Python, or CSS3???
Email real.artistry@gmail.com to help out. I can't promise money for all but there 
shall be some for key contributors.


For the software Revolution!
